    "Covid-19 has brought challenges and complications to the telecommunications industry. Large corporations, small business and households depend on telecom companies to operate their daily tasks. According to [IEE Communication Society,](https://techblog.comsoc.org/2020/08/27/covid-19-challenges-faced-by-telcos-and-impact-on-the-telecom-sector/)\"The unprecedented global health emergency is taxing networks and platforms to the limit, with some operators and platforms reporting demand spikes as high as 800%.”\n",
    "\n",
    "In the face of the uncertain future, customers are trying to strike a balance between expanding to meet higher demand in the short-term and preserving cash to weather a protracted economic downturn. The [IFC, International Financial Corporation](https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/1d490aec-4d57-4cbf-82b3-d6842eecd9b2/IFC-Covid19-Telecommunications_final_web_2.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CVID=n9nxogP) studies found that lower-income customer groups, who are experiencing the most damage, are expected to reduce or stop purchasing airtime and data bundles. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, Data Science can help mitigate the worries of this Telecommunication Company by focusing on the customer churn. Customer churn occurs when your customer or subscriber stops using your product or service within a specific time period. By creating prediction models that can mitigate customer churn, the company can focus resources and funding into maintaining its infrastructure. Since IFC states: \"Infrastructure operators such as tower companies and energy service companies (ESCOs) may see a drop in new contracts.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The model that was implemented to help with the customer churn rate was able to accurately predict a customer will churn 95% of the time. \n"

    "We can see quite interestingly that for this company, most of the customer base is on a Month-to-Month base. The main problem is that more of the customers are leaving from the Month-to-Month contracts than any other service offered. One thing to note, is that more customers have Two year contracts than One Year contracts.\n",

    "This aligns with the current situation that the world is going to. [Pewrsearch.org](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2015/04/01/chapter-one-a-portrait-of-smartphone-ownership/) explains that \" *Lower-income smartphone owners tend to subscribe to relatively low-cost plans covering only themselves as individuals rather than higher-cost group or family plans. Accordingly, individual plan subscribers are around twice as likely to have canceled or cut back service as those on group or family plans (34% of individual plan members and 18% of family plan members have done so), and those with relatively low-cost plans are actually more likely to have canceled or suspended service than those with more expensive plans*.\" \n",

    "In conclusion, in the EDA process we found that having a Month-to-Month contract greatly influenced the churn rate of the company and that the company suffers from an above average churn rate for a Telecom company. We also saw that customers who were paying more were the ones who left the company due to pricing but the customers who left due to Competitor's best offer had the most outlying charges and this was confirmed with the majority of customer's reason for leaving was due to the competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Viewing at coefficients showed us that customers who are in contracts are less likely to churn as well as customers who are happy enough with the company and are willing to have online security could mean that they are less likely to churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, the company could explore in providing affordable One Year contracts for customers who are month to moth, as the study from Pewresearch.com shows, most Month-to-Month customers tend to pay less for their contracts and this is a possible avenue to explore. Since in the EDA steps we see that the competition has provided with better offers, having a diverse contract options or more flexible services could improve customer retention.\n",

    "By also using this model and focus on the coefficients of the features, we could create a system that could alert if a customer has a higher chance of churn and the company can focus offers to increase retention rate."
